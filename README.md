GuavaPresentation
=================

This project was created as a presentation (yes a presentation, 'cause why not?) **to showcase some Guava Library featues**. It's intended to be used by navigating the examples throw an IDE. IntelliJ Idea 13 has a nice [presentation mode] which is great for this purpose.

You should probably start throgh [Agenda.java](src/main/java/guava/presentation/Agenda.java)

This presentation is heavily based on the [Guava Wiki] and complemenented with some extra examples.

*Please note that this presentation does not cover all of Guava features, some of them were intentionally excluded from this presentation.*
